## Overview

Developed and deployed a comprehensive campus management system to handle student records, faculty schedules, course registration, and fee tracking. The platform was designed to be modular, scalable, and responsive, ensuring smooth operation across departments.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate dashboards and access levels for students, faculty, and admins.
- **Student Information System**: Manage student profiles, transcripts, and enrollment history.
- **Course and Exam Management**: Real-time updates for course assignments, grades, and exam schedules.
- **Fee Management**: Integration with online payment gateways and auto-invoicing features.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for use on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN Stack)**: For building scalable APIs and interactive UI.
- **Docker & GitHub Actions**: For containerized deployments and CI/CD pipeline automation.
- **Firebase**: Used for notifications and user authentication.
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and performance optimization.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building for a large user base with differing needs required thorough planning of user roles and data flows. Ensuring seamless transitions between student lifecycle stages (e.g., new enrollment to alumni) pushed me to design flexible and modular components. Managing deployments via Docker and GitHub Actions ensured zero-downtime rollouts.

## Outcome

Successfully deployed in multiple university departments, the portal reduced manual paperwork by 70% and improved faculty-student interaction. The project highlighted the power of full-stack and DevOps integration in educational tech solutions.
