## Overview

This project involved developing a full-featured Point of Sale (POS) system tailored for small to mid-sized retail chains. The platform was designed to manage transactions, inventory, user roles, and store analytics in real time. It provides a reliable, responsive interface that works both online and offline.

## Key Features

- **Inventory Management**: Real-time inventory sync across all branches with low-stock alerts and reorder thresholds.
- **Sales & Billing**: Fast transaction processing with barcode scanning, multi-payment method support, and receipt printing.
- **User Roles**: Admin, cashier, and store manager roles with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize sales, revenue trends, top-performing products, and employee performance.
- **Offline Sync**: Local storage with auto-sync functionality when internet is restored.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: For fast and flexible schema-less inventory and sales data storage.
- **Express.js**: Backend API with JWT authentication and middleware-driven request handling.
- **React.js**: Dynamic, responsive frontend UI optimized for touchscreen POS systems.
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for RESTful APIs and WebSocket-based communication.
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For containerized deployments and consistent dev/stage/prod environments.
- **NGINX**: Used as a reverse proxy and load balancer in production.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipelines for linting, testing, and pushing images to Docker Hub.

## Challenges and Learnings

Managing real-time data consistency across multiple stores and handling network latency was a significant challenge. I implemented socket communication for live updates and used local caching for offline functionality. It also taught me how to manage microservice deployments and integrate monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Outcome

The POS system has been deployed in three regional stores and has processed over 50,000 transactions with zero downtime. Store managers report a 30% improvement in daily sales tracking accuracy and faster checkout processes. The modular architecture allows for easy scaling and feature extensions like loyalty programs and CRM.
