## Overview

CodeVisio is a specialized dashboard built to help teams visualize and monitor their CI/CD workflows, deployment processes, and application health. It integrates tightly with GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes to provide real-time updates on build status, container deployments, and infrastructure performance metrics.

## Key Features

- **Pipeline Visualization**: Real-time UI to view build stages, status, duration, and logs for each job in a GitHub Actions pipeline.
- **Docker & K8s Integration**: Visualize container deployments and resource utilization across pods and namespaces.
- **Automated Notifications**: Slack and email integration to alert teams on failed builds or infrastructure issues.
- **Infrastructure Insights**: Custom Grafana panels embedded directly into the dashboard for monitoring CPU, memory, and network usage.
- **Audit Logging**: Secure audit trail of who deployed what, when, and where — useful for compliance and rollback analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js & TailwindCSS**: For building the fast, responsive, and accessible UI dashboard.
- **Docker & Kubernetes**: Core platform integrations with container registries and deployment pipelines.
- **GitHub Actions**: For building and deploying CodeVisio itself, as well as ingesting build logs.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Metrics collection and visualization of infrastructure health data.
- **WebSockets**: For pushing live build and deploy updates to the dashboard without refresh.
- **NGINX & Certbot**: For reverse proxying and automated HTTPS with Let’s Encrypt.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was achieving real-time synchronization between GitHub Actions workflows and the dashboard without overloading the API. I built a lightweight WebSocket middleware to push updates triggered by GitHub webhook events. Another learning was handling secure, role-based access for different DevOps stakeholders, from developers to SREs.

## Outcome

CodeVisio was adopted internally by two product teams and reduced their deployment debugging time by 60%. It gave developers visibility into the deployment pipeline and empowered DevOps engineers with a single view for performance and reliability. It also streamlined on-call incident resolution and improved infrastructure transparency.
